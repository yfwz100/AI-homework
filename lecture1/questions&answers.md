   * Environment: roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers
   * Actuators: Steering wheel, accelerator, brake, signal, horn
   * Sensors: cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, engine sensors, keyboard

7. What are the properties of environment in a taxi driver system?

   The properties of environment is partially observable, stochastic, sequential, dynamic and continuous.

8. How many kinds of agents are introduced in the textbook? What are they?

   Simple reflex, model-based reflex, goal-based, utility-based.

9. Who invented the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’? And when?

   1956 Dartmouth meeting, invented by McCarthy.
